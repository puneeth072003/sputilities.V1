# Security Policy

We take the security of Sputilities and our users seriously. Thank you for
helping us keep the project and its community safe.

## Supported Versions

- The latest code in the `main` branch is supported.
- We aim to fix critical security issues in the most recent release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do NOT create public GitHub issues for sensitive security reports.

Instead, use one of the following private channels:

- Preferred: Use GitHub's "Report a vulnerability" (Security Advisories) to open a private report
- Email: your.email@example.com

When reporting, please include:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Any affected versions/commits
- Impact assessment (what could an attacker do?)
- Proposed remediation if you have one

We will acknowledge your report within 72 hours, and we aim to provide an
initial assessment within 5 business days.

## Public Disclosure

We will work with you to coordinate public disclosure, including timing and
credit (if desired). Please do not disclose the issue publicly until we have
released a fix and confirmed that users have had reasonable time to update.

## Scope

- This policy covers the code in this repository
- Third-party dependencies are out of scope; please report those issues to the
  respective maintainers

Thank you for your responsible disclosure and for helping improve the security
of Sputilities.
